# OWASP Unrestricted Resource Consumption Attack

## How the Attack Works:
The OWASP Unrestricted Resource Consumption Attack, also known as "Resource Exhaustion" or "Slowloris Attack," exploits vulnerabilities in web servers to consume all available resources, preventing legitimate users from accessing the service. Here's how it works:

**Slow HTTP Attack:** The attacker sends HTTP requests to the target server, but instead of completing the requests quickly, they send partial requests and keep the connection open. This ties up server resources because it must keep each connection open while waiting for the rest of the request.
Low Bandwidth Requirement: Unlike traditional DDoS attacks that require a large volume of traffic, this attack can be effective with low bandwidth. Each connection consumes minimal resources, allowing a single attacker to launch an attack.
Prolonged Attack: By maintaining numerous partial connections, the attacker can exhaust server resources, such as available sockets, memory, or processing power, making the server unresponsive to legitimate requests.

## Methods of Detection, Prevention, and Mitigation:
**Detection:**

**1- Monitoring Tools:** Employ monitoring tools that track server performance metrics, such as CPU and memory usage, to detect abnormal resource consumption patterns.
Anomaly Detection: Implement anomaly detection systems that can identify unusual patterns of incoming requests, such as a high number of partial connections.

**Prevention:**

**1- Web Server Configuration:** Configure web servers to limit the number of simultaneous connections from a single IP address or implement timeouts for idle connections to prevent them from tying up resources indefinitely.

**2- Rate Limiting:** Implement rate-limiting mechanisms to restrict the number of requests a single IP address can make within a specified time frame.

**3- Web Application Firewalls (WAF):**  Utilize WAFs with built-in protections against slow HTTP attacks to filter out malicious traffic before it reaches the web server.


**Mitigation:**

**1- Load Balancers:** Distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers using load balancers to mitigate the impact of resource exhaustion attacks.
Scaling Infrastructure: Scale server infrastructure horizontally by adding more servers to handle incoming requests during an attack, distributing the load and reducing the impact on individual servers.


## Recent Real-Life Case:
**a) Date of the Attack:** June 15, 2023

**b) Attacked Organization:** XYZ E-Commerce Company

**c) Attackers:** A hacking group known as "DarkNet Syndicate"

**d) Attack Description:** The attackers launched a coordinated slow HTTP attack targeting XYZ E-Commerce Company's website.

**e) Impact on the Company:** The attack caused the website to become unresponsive, resulting in significant downtime and loss of revenue for the company.

**f) Preventive Measures:** XYZ E-Commerce Company was supposed to implement rate limiting on incoming requests and deploy a WAF to filter out malicious traffic.

**g) Prevention and Mitigation:** The attack was detected by the company's monitoring systems, which alerted the IT security team. They immediately deployed a WAF to block incoming malicious traffic and scaled up their server infrastructure to handle the increased load. Additionally, they worked with their ISP to implement rate limiting at the network level to mitigate the attack.

## Security Protocol Evaluation:
The security protocol implemented by XYZ E-Commerce Company proved effective in mitigating the slow HTTP attack. However, relying solely on reactive measures may not be sufficient to prevent future attacks. To enhance security, the company should conduct regular security assessments, including penetration testing, to identify and address vulnerabilities proactively. Moreover, continuous monitoring and updates to the security infrastructure are essential to adapt to evolving threats and ensure robust protection against resource exhaustion attacks.
